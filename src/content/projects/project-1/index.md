I started my work as Head of Design for the GIIS Tech Club in December of last year; since then we've become a non-profit organization, partnered with one of the largest banks in Southeast Asia, and empowered hundreds of teenagers to learn and pursue skills in STEM.  

This is essentially an archive of our brand.
## GIIS Hackathon X
After six months of hard work and countless hours of reiteration, Hackathon X finally materialized. Our Hackathon was generously sponsored by DBS Singapore, Hack Club, and Wolfram Alpha, making it completely free for all students and significantly increasing its accessibility. Despite being free, <b>we didn’t compromise</b> on anything. We set the bar so high that future iterations of GIIS Tech Club may not even come close to matching our achievements. From merchandise and delicious food to prizes, film cameras, a photo booth, various consoles, and even two massive Mario Kart arcade machines, we had everything.

As for the Design side of things, I personally created the following:
- Hackathon X t-shirts
- Lanyards and PVCs
- Stickers!
- Stage Graphics and Design
- Posters (as well as a NFC photosystem that showed participants their pictures live as the event went on)

 Additionally, I also made content for our social media. (This [reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C99zJphvfSC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) for instance)

## Bits&Bytes
We wanted to do more with our platform, we wanted to truly <i>empower</i> students. So we started where all things start, and had our own Seed Funding Round! (we sold popcorn and profited off the impulsiveness of teenagers)

Now, design-wise, this time I just had to create "postcards", some posters, our official club banner, and another (fire) [reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DA-bbZrvaAL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==).

Oh..WE ALSO RAISED 800 SGD!
## You ship, We ship.
YSWS, otherwise known as "You ship, We ship," was one of our final initiatives. We encouraged students in our school to program and build their own website, and we offered to pay for their domains! Through YSWS, you could either meet some basic prerequisites and be eligible to receive your own custom domain, paid for by us; or you could get a fun, completely accessible-to-all giistech.club subdomain. This was all done through GitHub, and you can check out the [repo](https://github.com/emergenitro/ysws-domain) yourself. (shoutout our amazing secretary Karthik Sankar!)

Now design-wise since this was a virtual initiative, all I had to do was get the word out. One way I did this was through an [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBLR5DuPFpT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)

I also made these posters featuring my good friend Mayush. (don't search up yourwebsite.giistech.club).

## Jackets
I just HAD to mention our official club jackets. This was my first time designing a varsity jacket, and I think it ended up pretty well.

## Conclusion of sorts
GIIS Tech Club will always hold a special place in my memories, and I'm so beyond fulfilled with all the things we were able to accomplish and all the people we were able to positively impact. Of course, there are a lot of things I did that I hadn't mentioned (like basically 99% of our social media, for instance); honestly, I just got kind of tired of updating the index.md file for this. Anyways, if you're interested, check out @giistechclub on Instagram.
