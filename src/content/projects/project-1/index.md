I started my work as Head of Design for the GIIS Tech Club in December of last year; since then we've become a non-profit organization, partnered with one of the largest banks in Southeast Asia, and empowered hundreds of teenagers to learn and pursue skills in STEM.  

This is essentially an archive of our brand.

## GIIS Hackathon X
After 6 months of work, and dozens of hours of reiterating, Hackathon X finally happened. Our Hackathon had been sponsored by DBS Singapore, Hack Club, and Wolfram Alpha; enabling us to make it free to all students and therefore more accessible. Despite being free, we compromised on <b>nothing</b>, setting the bar so high future iterations of GIIS Tech Club may not even come close. From merchandise, delicious food, prizes, film cameras, a photo booth, various consoles, and even 2 massive Mario Kart arcade machines‚Äî-we had everything.

As for the Design side of things, I personally created the following:
- Hackathon X t-shirts
- Lanyards and PVCs
- Stickers!
- Stage Graphics and Design
- Posters (as well as a NFC photosystem that showed participants their pictures live as the event went on)

 Additionally, I also made content for our social media. (This [reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C99zJphvfSC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) for instance)
